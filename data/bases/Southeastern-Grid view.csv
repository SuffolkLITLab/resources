The care at Cape Cod Comprehensive Treatment Centers is customized to ensure that each patient receives the medications and therapeutic interventions that are best designed to meet their unique needs.
This dedication to customized care means that the cost of treatment may vary from patient to patient. However, because we understand that cost-related concerns can undermine patients’ efforts to focus their full attention on their recovery, we conduct open conversations with all patients prior to the start of treatment to confirm the cost of their care and to verify how they will pay for the services that they receive.

Though costs and payments will vary, certain standard policies and procedures will apply to all who choose to heal at Cape Cod Comprehensive Treatment Centers.

First, all patients, even those who will be using insurance benefits to pay for their treatment, are expected to pay their intake fees on the day of their intake appointment. These fees may be paid with cash, money orders, or major credit cards. Credit cards must be issued in the name of the person who is paying for treatment. (If someone other than the patient is paying, that person must be present when the credit card is used.)

Additional payment information:

All patients are expected to pay for treatment in advance of receiving services.
This policy applies to customers who are paying for their own care, as well as to most insurance patients as well.
Insurance patients will be provided with an invoice that they can submit to their insurance provider in order to be reimbursed for eligible out-of-pocket expenses.
Insurance patients must provide a valid insurance card during their intake appointment and must have their eligibility and coverage confirmed by one of our staff members.
If you have any questions about treatment costs or any other aspects of receiving care at Cape Cod Comprehensive Treatment Centers, please feel free to contact us at your convenience.
