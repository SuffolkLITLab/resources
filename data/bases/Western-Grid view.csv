The Brien Center’s Programs and Services are “Community Based”
Our agency is organized around four divisions that address the behavioral health needs of Berkshire County residents using a “community-based care” model. This means our services are delivered where people live, work, shop, worship, go to school and raise their families. With over 25 locations throughout Berkshire County, treatment and services are conveniently available to all Berkshire County residents.

What is “Continuum of Care”?
Continuum of care is an integrated system that guides and tracks people served through a comprehensive array of behavioral health services from various providers. We ensure there are no gaps in care and support recovery and wellness to the highest degree possible.

What is “Integrated Care”?
Integrated care is a system of coordinated care that “integrates” the various aspects of mental health, addiction, and primary care services for the best possible outcomes for people in our care. To achieve these ends, we work closely with physicians and other care providers to keep the lines of communication open. This method of care is proven to be the most effective approach to caring for people with multiple healthcare needs.

Community-wide Collaboration
We are proud to work as part of a strong, well-developed network of collaborative partners to ensure the people of Berkshire County have access to the behavioral healthcare services they need.",The Brien Center is an approved provider for most public and private health insurance plans. A sliding fee scale is offered for those who have no health insurance.,https://www.briencenter.org/,(413) 499-0412,,2019-08-08,42.449370,-73.246140,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0
