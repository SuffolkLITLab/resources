CHAMP is the website where you can apply for state-aided public housing. Through the online system, this website lets you submit your application to one or more housing authorities, instead of having to mail or hand deliver an application to each housing authority separately. You can also keep your application information up-to-date on this website as it changes. This will help you to make sure that housing authorities know how to contact you. If you have an active application at one or more local housing authorities, you can find it on this website and manage it on this website. Do not file a new application. Once you find your existing application on the website, you can make changes such as updating contact information and adding or removing your applications to housing authorities. It is important to only apply to those housing authorities where you are willing to live. Vouchers and federally subsidized public housing units are not yet available through this site. However, if you are interested in applying for those programs, please contact a local housing authority or regional administering agency (RAA) directly.",https://publichousingapplication.ocd.state.ma.us/,,,,2019-05-07,42.407,-71.382,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
