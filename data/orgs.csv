At Yarmouth Comprehensive Treatment Center, we supply programming options for these individuals that provide the complete care needed to overcome their addiction. Our care includes a mixture of therapeutic methods and the implementation of medications that are proven to be safe and effective in treating opioid addiction.

With a staff of incredibly talented nurses, counselors, and physicians, Yarmouth Comprehensive Treatment Center is pleased to provide patients with a safe and encouraging environment to work in as they make their way towards full recovery. When patients come to us grappling with addictions to substances such as heroin, prescription painkillers, or morphine, our kind and empathetic team of professionals go to all ends to monitor the prescription and administration of the medications we utilize to ensure that each patient obtains the best outcomes possible. The medications that we supply to help treat opioid addiction here at Yarmouth Comprehensive Treatment Center include: Subutex, Suboxone, Methadone.

The specific medication that is supplied will be based on the needs of each patient and his or her health status. The dosage that is recommended, as well as any alterations to that dosage, will be customized so that all of the patient’s needs are being met. Dosage recommendations and changes will be conducted by one of our medical professionals.

Saturday & Sunday: 6:00am – 9:15am","First, to be treated at one of our centers, you must be 18 years of age or older, and you must have been opioid dependent for at least 12 months.

If you meet these eligibility requirements, we will schedule your intake appointment. At the outset of this appointment, you will be required to provide the following:

-Valid photo identification (Driver’s license, state ID card, or passport)
-Payment for intake fee (cash, money order, or a major credit card issued in the name of the payer); we are not able to accept personal checks or payment by phone
-Proof of insurance, if you are planning to use insurance to pay for your treatment
If you are transferring directly from detox or from another medication assisted treatment program, you will need to provide all necessary documentation from your prior program.
Important Note: Unless you are pregnant, you must arrive for your intake appointment in a state of withdrawal, without having used any opiates within the previous 20 to 24 hours. If you are pregnant, you should not be in withdrawal when you arrive for your intake appointment

Please plan to be at the center for about four hours for your intake appointment. During that time, the following will occur:

-You will be given educational information and provided with a copy of our Patient Handbook.
-You will meet with a staff member for intake paperwork and assessments and have your picture taken for internal identification purposes.
-You will be asked to sign Releases of Confidential Information forms so that we may coordinate care with your primary care physician and other relevant healthcare providers.
-You will provide an Oral Drug Screen to assess opioid and other drug use.
-You will be seen by a clinician to complete a comprehensive biopsychosocial assessment.
You will be scheduled for blood work and TB testing.
You will be scheduled to meet with a member of our medical staff for a physical exam.
If you are female, you will be given a pregnancy test.
Your first dose of medication generally occurs the same day that you are approved for admission into our program, however, we cannot guarantee that this will occur. All medication decisions are determined on a case-by-case basis following an assessment by our medical director.

For additional information about any aspect of care at Cape Cod Comprehensive Treatment Centers, please feel free to contact us at your convenience. We look forward to speaking with you and providing you with the information you need to determine if we have the solutions that you have been searching for.

The care at Cape Cod Comprehensive Treatment Centers is customized to ensure that each patient receives the medications and therapeutic interventions that are best designed to meet their unique needs.
This dedication to customized care means that the cost of treatment may vary from patient to patient. However, because we understand that cost-related concerns can undermine patients’ efforts to focus their full attention on their recovery, we conduct open conversations with all patients prior to the start of treatment to confirm the cost of their care and to verify how they will pay for the services that they receive.

Though costs and payments will vary, certain standard policies and procedures will apply to all who choose to heal at Cape Cod Comprehensive Treatment Centers.

First, all patients, even those who will be using insurance benefits to pay for their treatment, are expected to pay their intake fees on the day of their intake appointment. These fees may be paid with cash, money orders, or major credit cards. Credit cards must be issued in the name of the person who is paying for treatment. (If someone other than the patient is paying, that person must be present when the credit card is used.)

Additional payment information:

All patients are expected to pay for treatment in advance of receiving services.
This policy applies to customers who are paying for their own care, as well as to most insurance patients as well.
Insurance patients will be provided with an invoice that they can submit to their insurance provider in order to be reimbursed for eligible out-of-pocket expenses.
Insurance patients must provide a valid insurance card during their intake appointment and must have their eligibility and coverage confirmed by one of our staff members.
If you have any questions about treatment costs or any other aspects of receiving care at Cape Cod Comprehensive Treatment Centers, please feel free to contact us at your convenience. Our friendly and supportive staff members look forward to providing you with all of the information necessary to make the best decisions about getting the help you need to overcome your opioid dependence.",https://www.capecodctc.com/location/yarmouth/,(877) 624-1850,,2019-04-03,41.686704,-70.212182,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0

Our young people are resilient and we build off their strengths to support them in improving their grades, complete high school and proceed to post-secondary education through IBA’s partnership with Bunker Hill Community College.

Our program employs youth as peer leaders. We hire 20 youth as peer leaders during the school year and 25 during the summer.

School Year: October to May (28 weeks), Monday through Friday.

Daily Workshops: Our art workshops range from poetry and spoken word, photography and videography, to visual arts and movement. They are custom made to fit the needs and interests of our youth. We also offer Life Skills workshops, academic support, and community service opportunities. All of our programming has a strong social justice and civic engagement component, and our young people are actively involved in organizing, advocating, and using the arts as a means to spread the word about issues that affect them and our community.",,http://www.ibaboston.org/youth-development/,(617) 927-1707,info@ibaboston.org,2018-03-26,42.340621,-71.073524,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
Inner City Weight Lifting,15,24,All,Contact program for address.,,"Our brains are wired to make assumptions that help us navigate a complex and, at times, dangerous world. For instance, if we see a group of young people who look different, dress different, have years of trauma expressed in their eyes, standing in a “rough” area of the city, most people will cross the street to avoid. Our instincts are clear to this point: there’s a threat to our safety. But what if our instincts are wrong, what if these young people aren’t the problem? What if they are the solution? This is what we see time and time again in our gyms. Young people who have been labeled “high impact” gang members, becoming driven to lead their lives, and the lives of their friends and family in a positive direction. It starts with trust, with hope, and turns into inclusion and economic mobility.

Once we’ve established hope, our goal is to turn belief into action by providing as many positive solutions as possible – one of those being our best in class in-house career track in personal training. Students are able to learn from some of the top training coaches in the country, mastering a highly marketable skill-set. 

Through training our students gain economic mobility, as they start training clients and earning $20 - $60/hr. Perhaps more importantly, they benefit from social inclusion as the worlds of our students, staff, clients, and corporate partners merge together creating new networks and access to new opportunities.

Finally, in the last stage of our model, students are empowered with control over their future. They choose which path they move along. As communities and networks become inclusive, as people gain an understanding for each other, the factors that led to segregated pockets of violence begin to fade, changing the course for our students, and for future generations. 

Our personal training clients are a critical piece of this network. As more individuals from opposite socio-economic backgrounds visit our gym and pay, a wide-scale systemic change begins. Clients see our students for who they are, not the false labels society has placed upon them. Our students are able to see the world and be seen by it in a whole new way.",,https://www.innercityweightlifting.org,,,2018-03-26,42.321824,-71.088404,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

3. Clinical Case Management:
Youth and their families are seen weekly with the focus on parent guidance and support counseling. Clients may have pre-existing relationships with major service providers like DYS, DCF, and school-based services. YouthConnect social workers help facilitate case conferences to have providers and systems come together to identify roles and coordinate culturally appropriate care given the needs of the family. This level of services is open-ended with an eye towards creating a safety net of services for the youth and family.

4. Therapy Services:
Youth and their families are seen weekly in therapy for issues related to truancy, delinquency, safety issues, substance use, victimization due to community violence, school performance and family functioning. Youth are generally seen individually, and family meetings are monthly. YouthConnect provides home visits and community based visits, in addition to flexible scheduling, enabling high-risk youth and their families access to social service.

From Ms. Perry:
Our program is not a location-based program, nor does it have a specific time component to it.  We are MSW-level clinical social workers that offer a variety of clinical services and supports to high-risk and proven risk youth and families.  Services are determined after we complete a comprehensive psychosocial assessment with the family to determine their strengths, needs and goals.  From there a customized treatment plan is put in place.  Services could be simply a connection to existing community-based resources; it could be ongoing clinical case management and advocacy, or it could be providing individual therapy.

We are funded to work with young people referred through the Boston Police Department.  Any time a non-BPD provider is hoping to make a referral to YouthConnect, the request must be made to YouthConnect’s Clinical Director, Denise Kasrawi who will then determine if the referral is clinical appropriate for our services and if we have the capacity to properly serve the young person.",,https://www.bgcb.org/what-we-do/youthconnect/,(617) 427-1068,aperry@bgcb.org,2018-03-26,42.356957,-71.051913,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

This is difficult, however, when they are trapped in a ""survival mode"" that threatens their ability to concentrate in school and depletes their energy because of worries relating to where they will spend the next night or how they will get food.

YouthHarbors works to ensure that these youth are safely housed so they can concentrate on school, and that they are given all the tools and skills they need to be able to focus on their future and achieve success.

The YouthHarbors program works because it operates with a dynamic, can-do attitude and meets youth where they are, using a wrap-around service delivery model to meet each youth's individual needs.

YouthHarbors begins with the identification of a high school student who is homeless or at risk of becoming homeless. Students are deemed eligible for the program based solely on the criteria of being unaccompanied and homeless.

Housing:

YouthHarbors staff works to find the student stable, long-term housing once immediate shelter needs are met. Housing options range from housing with extended family or friends to finding an apartment with suitable roommates, but a student can occasionally be placed with a host family.

Individualized Life Skills Workshops:

These workshops are individually tailored to each student, vary widely, and can include workshops that are:

Career-Oriented: Finding a job, writing a resume, or improving interview skills.
Domestic: Cooking food safely, maintaining an apartment, doing laundry, managing and negotiating roommate relationships.
Academic: Planning educational goals, connecting with academic tutors.

Bikes Not Bombs -Girls in Action,12,18,Female,"284 Amory Street
Jamaica Plain, MA 02130",,"Girls In Action is BNB’s all-girls program. Program cost is $25-$50 sliding scale - you decide how much you can pay. In addition to mechanics, GIA offers fitness, safety, and environmental activities, as well as weekly workshops or field trips! You might visit an urban farm, learn how to do henna tattoos, or do community service, all while meeting other cool girls and learning how to completely rebuild a bike.

Earn-A-Bike is a learning and earning bicycle program. Over the course of the six-week program, participants will completely overhaul a bicycle while learning how to safely ride and navigate the city of Boston. During mechanics lessons, participants will be taught how to repair a part of the bicycle; then they’ll roll up their sleeves and do it themselves. On group bike rides, participants will learn the ins and outs of Boston’s system of bike lanes and paths, riding to and from parks, basketball courts and local businesses.

There are no lectures in Earn-A-Bike: you pick out a bike (choose from mountain, road, or BMX bikes), you learn how to rebuild it, and then you get to keep it! (as long as you’ve earned enough credits, that is)

To qualify for enrollment, BOTH the application (filled out) and payment (cash, check or money order) need to be submitted. If you are unable to afford any class fee, you can submit a fee waiver request instead of payment, and this will not affect whether or not you are accepted to the course. If you are not accepted into the program for any reason, you will be notified and your program fee will be returned.",,https://bikesnotbombs.org/girls-in-action,(617) 522-0222,elijah@bikesnotbombs.org,2018-03-26,42.314727,-71.104549,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
Bikes Not Bombs- Pathways: Youth Employment Program,15,18,All,"284 Amory Street Jamaica Plain, MA 02130",,"All of Bikes Not Bombs programs are run by Youth Employees, program alumni who are trained to teach mechanics lessons, lead group rides and be amazing peer leaders. Youth Employees at Bikes Not Bombs also receive one-on-one mentorship and professional development training in resume and cover letter writing, job interview practice, gender sensitivity and teaching techniques. Teens may also be employed to work with Chain Reaction, BNB's mobile bike shop program. The Youth Employees at Bikes Not Bombs focus on three main topics in their work as peer leaders, the environment, bike safety and mechanics.

Youth Programs at Bikes Not Bombs teach young people how to rebuild bikes with recycled parts, and help get youth comfortable using a non-polluting mode of transportation. Our Youth Employees also really love using The Story of Stuff to teach about planned obsolesence, or inviting an organizer from the Alliance for Climate Change to show youth the ways they can help stop global warming.

Every young person who graduates from Earn-A-Bike or Girls In Action goes home with a bicycle AND a helmet. Youth are never allowed on or even near a bicycle without a helmet and our instructors lead them in a safety check before every single ride. Our Youth Employees also know how to make safety education fun. To teach about head injuries they lead BNB's famous Helmet Egg Drop activity in which an egg stands in for a helmet-less rider with some disasterous results. During our Bike Rodeo, Youth Employees teach participants hand signals and emergency stops, skills they have to master before we take them on a ride. If you've ever seen a large group of youth on bikes, with several wearing bright orange reflective vests, shouting things like, ""BIKER BACK,"" and ""CAR UP,"" then you've seen BNB on a group ride. Some of our favorite spots to ride to are Jamaica Pond, The Arnold Arboretum, and Franklin Park. 

From the very first day of a BNB Youth Program, participants get their hands on bikes and tools. They start by stripping a bike, with teams competing to find the smallest, largest, cleanest and dirtiest parts. This is a way for youth to get comfortable with tools, and not worry about messing up the bike they'll eventually take home. Soon, participants move on to tougher skills like flat fixing, overhauling hubs and adjusting brakes and derailleurs. Every lesson that youth participants learn is developed and taught by our Youth Employees, and all of our step-by-step lesson plans can be found in our Earn-A-Bike Training Manual.",Must successfully complete two Bikes Not Bombs programs,https://bikesnotbombs.org/pathways-youth-employment-program,(617) 522-0222,elijah@bikesnotbombs.org,2018-03-26,42.314727,-71.104549,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

The care at Cape Cod Comprehensive Treatment Centers is customized to ensure that each patient receives the medications and therapeutic interventions that are best designed to meet their unique needs.
This dedication to customized care means that the cost of treatment may vary from patient to patient. However, because we understand that cost-related concerns can undermine patients’ efforts to focus their full attention on their recovery, we conduct open conversations with all patients prior to the start of treatment to confirm the cost of their care and to verify how they will pay for the services that they receive.

Though costs and payments will vary, certain standard policies and procedures will apply to all who choose to heal at Cape Cod Comprehensive Treatment Centers.

First, all patients, even those who will be using insurance benefits to pay for their treatment, are expected to pay their intake fees on the day of their intake appointment. These fees may be paid with cash, money orders, or major credit cards. Credit cards must be issued in the name of the person who is paying for treatment. (If someone other than the patient is paying, that person must be present when the credit card is used.)

Additional payment information:

All patients are expected to pay for treatment in advance of receiving services.
This policy applies to customers who are paying for their own care, as well as to most insurance patients as well.
Insurance patients will be provided with an invoice that they can submit to their insurance provider in order to be reimbursed for eligible out-of-pocket expenses.
Insurance patients must provide a valid insurance card during their intake appointment and must have their eligibility and coverage confirmed by one of our staff members.
If you have any questions about treatment costs or any other aspects of receiving care at Cape Cod Comprehensive Treatment Centers, please feel free to contact us at your convenience.
