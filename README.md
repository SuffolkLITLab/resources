# Massachusetts Resource Directory

The repo serves the [Massachusetts Resource Directory](https://mareentryresources.org/). It app was created by Suffolk University Law School's Legal Innovation & Technology Lab, Dismas House of Massachusetts, Inc., the Crime Justice Institute (CJI), and the Criminal Justice Task Force (CJTF) of Northeastern University School of Law, with financial support from The Shaw Foundation. Resources are maintained by Dismas House and CJI. This list of resources is not exhaustive. Do not rely on it as your only list of services.
