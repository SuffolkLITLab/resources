SOA continues the treatment efforts for those convicted of their second driving-under-the-influence offense (must have completed theÂ\xa0Second Offender 14-Day Residential Program for Driving Under the Influence of Liquor (DUIL)).The Ayer Drug Court Program is a post-adjudication outpatient program; eligible participants can enter the program at various stages of case processing, including arraignment, pre-trial hearing and violation of probation hearings. In addition to these three programs, Advocates Inc. offers outpatient services and group therapy.\nEligibility and Fees\nEligibility varies by program and services.\nFor Ayer Drug Court the program is 52 weeks, including four phases of treatment and is intended forÂ\xa0Male and female non-violent adult offenders who reside within the court's jurisdiction, are assessed as having an alcohol and/or other drug (AOD) problem and have no prior record of violent offense.\nEach participant entering the program has a legal disposition that includes the potential for incarceration or a defined house of correction (county correctional institution) sentence that has been suspended.\nSOA is intended for individuals convicted of driving under the influence for a second time. Individuals may choose this option as an alternative to at least 30 days incarceration. Referrals will be made by the Adjudicating Courts as well as the DUIL Program as part of their aftercare support. Completion of this program is one of several requirements that an individual must fulfill in order to be considered for a hardship driver's license from the Registry of Motor Vehicles.\nDAE is intended for individuals convicted of driving under the influence for the first time and who choose this option as an alternative to losing their license or possible incarceration. Referrals are generally made by the adjudicating district court; however, if the client is under 21, the Registry of Motor Vehicles may mandate the participant's participation.For outpatient care:\nPsychiatric Emergency Services (PES) are available to any individual of any age who is in need of emergency mental health and substance abuse services, regardless of insurance or capacity to self-pay. There is no charge to the individual from Advocates for this service.\nAdvocates Community Counseling (ACC) contracts with most major insurances.

While some programs serve only domesticÂ\xa0orÂ\xa0sexual violence survivors, New Hope is aÂ\xa0dual missionÂ\xa0agency which addresses both issues together. Since domestic and sexual violence are often intertwined, our clients benefit from the full spectrum of programs we offer, allowing them to receive domestic and sexual violence services all in one place.\nWe offer a wide range of services which combine crisis intervention, violence prevention, life transition and self-sufficiency opportunities, while promoting behavioral and systemic changes to reduce violence at the individual and community levels.\nToll-Free, 24-Hour Confidential Hotline\nOur trained hotline specialists assist callers with crisis intervention, risk assessment, and safety planning. Callers are also provided with information about New Hopeâ\x80\x99s services and other community resources to address domestic and sexual violence.\nOur Hotline is also available to family members, friends, neighbors and co-workers who may be concerned about someone they know that may be a survivor of domestic or sexual violence.\nEmergency Shelter\nWe provide women, men, and children safe haven in New Hopeâ\x80\x99s two confidential emergency shelters. While at the shelter, clients receive crisis intervention, counseling, economic literacy training, financial advocacy and case management, including a housing plan.\nCounseling\nDedicated to supporting both groups and individuals, trained counselors work with children, adolescent, and adult survivors of domestic and sexual violence.\nSAFEPLAN\nAdvocates stationed in seven district courts and one probate court assist individuals with obtaining restraining and harassment orders. These advocates are located in Attleboro, Dudley, East Brookfield, Milford, Taunton (District and Probate), Westborough and Uxbridge. This program is partially supported by the Massachusetts Office for Victim Assistance (MOVA) through the 1984 VOCA grant from OVC, OJP, US D.O.J.\nCommunity-Based Advocacy\nCommunity advocates assist individuals with finding resources to enhance their safety while staying in their home community. Local assistance aims to minimize future risk and prevents the need to flee to shelter.\nSupervised Visitation\nLocated at the MJ Leadenham Center in our Worcester office, supervised visitation is provided to non-custodial parents due to a prior history of domestic or sexual violence. Staff model healthy parenting skills with these adults while they visit their children in a safe, monitored and nurturing setting.\nHousing Stabilization\nOur housing stabilization program provides individuals with funding for rent, utilities, or other costs necessary for providing stable, reliable housing which was jeopardized as a result of domestic or sexual violence.\nCivilian Police Advocate\nOur civilian advocate in the Attleboro Police Station provides individuals with services such as crisis intervention, safety planning, and assistance with the criminal justice system.\nRelevant keywords: hotline', 'Website': nan, 'Phone': '(508) 753-3146', 'Email': 'new-hope@new-hope.org', 'Valid As Of': '2023-02-16', 'Latitude': 41.94343320000001, 'Longitude': -71.2779037}, {'tags': [], 'Name': 'New Hope', 'Minimum Age': 0.0, 'Maximum Age': 100.0, 'Address': '247 Maple Street, Attleboro, MA 02703', 'Description': 'Toll-Free, 24-Hour Confidential Hotline, Emergency Shelter, Counseling, SAFEPLAN, Community-Based Advocacy, Supervised Visitation, Housing Stabilization, Civilian Police Advocate', 'Website': 'http://www.new-hope.org/', 'Phone': nan, 'Email': nan, 'Valid As Of': '2023-02-16', 'Latitude': 41.9359244, 'Longitude': -71.26408070000001}, {'tags': [], 'Name': 'New England Counseling Center', 'Minimum Age': 0.0, 'Maximum Age': 100.0, 'Address': '800 S Main Street, #103, Mansfield, MA 02048', 'Description': 'THERAPY\nIncludes Counseling\nCognitive-Behavioral Therapy\nTherapy for Substance Abuse\nGrief & Loss Counseling\nLGBT Issues Counseling\nTransgender Transitioning Issues\nTherapy for Depression\nTherapy for Anxiety\nFamily/Couple Counseling', 'Website': 'http://newenglandpsychiatry.com/', 'Phone': '(508) 261-7111', 'Email': nan, 'Valid As Of': '2023-02-16', 'Latitude': 41.997149, 'Longitude': -71.210101}, {'tags': [], 'Name': 'New Bedford Housing Authority', 'Minimum Age': 0.0, 'Maximum Age': 100.0, 'Address': '134 South Second Street, New Bedford, MA 02740', 'Description': 'Office Hours Mondayâ\x80\x93Friday, 8:30 am â\x80\x93 4:We recommend you call your local housing authority for low cost and affordable housing options along with finding area resources for affordable housing options and locations for area shelters in their area.\nWebsite:', 'Website': 'https://newbedfordhousingauthority.org/', 'Phone': '(508) 997-4800', 'Email': nan, 'Valid As Of': '2023-02-16', 'Latitude': 41.630663500000004, 'Longitude': -70.92312690000001}, {'tags': [], 'Name': 'Nearly New Shop', 'Minimum Age': 0.0, 'Maximum Age': 100.0, 'Address': '56 Union Street, Middleborough, MA 02346', 'Description': 'Consignment shop', 'Website': nan, 'Phone': '(508) 947-4492', 'Email': nan, 'Valid As Of': '2023-02-16', 'Latitude': 41.8916695, 'Longitude': -70.91216340000001}, {'tags': [], 'Name': 'Nader Mental Health Services, LLC', 'Minimum Age': 0.0, 'Maximum Age': 100.0, 'Address': '132 Central Street, STE 212, Foxborough, MA 02035', 'Description': 'All types of mental health services .

We provide a lightly structured, drug free environment. This supportive environment\nis maintained through 24-hour staffing and case management services. The social model and milieu encourages house residents to provide one another with a culture of recovery, support, sharing, and positive peer role modeling. The programs are built on the philosophy that each individual must learn to take responsibility for their own recovery process.\nOur dedicated staff establish and nurture a safe, drug-free, health-oriented, supportive environment steeped in the culture of recovery. As residents cross the threshold of the programs, they will not be faced with the imposition of a tightly structured daily schedule. Rather, the houses operate from the premise that residents have an illness of addiction, have entered into abstinence/recovery, and need to take advantage of a safe place to acquire added skills and supports to ensure that their illness remains in remission.\nThe goal of every resident is to establish meaningful drug-free living with a\nreturn to independent living in the community. Referral mechanisms exist to provide residents with outpatient substance abuse counseling, mental health services, vocational rehabilitation, educational and literacy services, and housing assistance services.
